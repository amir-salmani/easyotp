# Decision log

Format: one decision per entry. Date, what was chosen, what was rejected, why.
Decisions here are settled — reopen only with new evidence, don't re-derive.

---

## D1 — Native Kotlin, not Tauri (2026-08-30)

**Chosen:** 100% native Android (Kotlin + Jetpack Compose). No Tauri, no WebView.

**Rejected:** Tauri v2 Android shell with a Kotlin plugin for the capture path.

**Why:** A Tauri app is a WebView + Rust process. When Android kills that process —
and it will, unattended, within hours — the Rust and JS are gone. A manifest-declared
`BroadcastReceiver` for `SMS_RECEIVED` still fires with the app dead, because it is
exempt from the implicit-broadcast ban. That means the entire critical path had to be
Kotlin regardless, leaving Tauri as a UI skin over a native engine: added toolchain,
added build surface, added APK size, zero benefit. Compose does the same job natively.

---

## D2 — Two front doors, one origin (2026-08-30)

**Chosen:** `otp.services.amirsalmani.com` (Cloudflare zone → Worker custom domain) and
`otp.services.rhinocloud.ir` (ArvanCloud CDN → origin `*.workers.dev`). Both terminate
at the same Worker.

**Rejected:** SMS fallback to a foreign number; independent second origin on an
Iranian VPS.

**Why (and the limit):** The dominant real-world failure is Iranian consumer ISPs
DPI/SNI-blocking Cloudflare edge. The Arvan leg defeats that, because Arvan's
international transit is not the path a consumer handset takes. It is fast (domestic,
sub-50ms) and survives most disruption.

It does **not** survive a full international cutoff — then Arvan→Cloudflare fails too.
These are two front doors on one origin, not two failure domains. With SMS fallback
declined, a national shutdown means messages queue on-device and deliver on restore.
This is an accepted trade, made knowingly, not an oversight.

**Escape hatch if it ever matters:** a second origin hosted inside Iran makes the two
legs genuinely independent failure domains. Deferred, not designed away.

**To verify before building the .ir leg:** whether ArvanCloud permits a foreign origin
at all, and whether it can override the Host header to the `workers.dev` hostname
(Workers route by Host; without the override the origin fetch 404s). Arvan's own docs
are unreachable from outside Iran — check from inside the country, or via the panel.

## D3 — Stateless relay, no database (2026-08-30)

**Chosen:** Worker persists nothing. All state — message archive, routing rules,
destinations, credentials — lives on the phone. One Durable Object per channel acts
as a **memory-only mailbox** for the seconds between a Telegram webhook arriving and
the phone's long-poll collecting it. No storage writes.

**Rejected:** D1 archive, KV-backed config, server-side dashboard.

**Why:** Bidirectional messaging needs a rendezvous point, because the phone is behind
CGNAT and cannot be reached inbound. A memory-only DO is the minimum structure that
provides one. Anything persistent turns the relay into a target holding other people's
OTPs, which is the exact thing the product exists to avoid. "We store nothing" has to
be literally true or it is worthless.

---

## D4 — Bring-your-own bot; pairing approved on-device (2026-08-30)

**Chosen:** Each user creates their own bot via @BotFather and pastes the token into
the app. The app seals it and calls `/enroll`; the **Worker** calls Telegram
`setWebhook` on the phone's behalf, then discards the token. The token rides inside
the sealed envelope on every subsequent forward and is used transiently.

Destination pairing: user messages their own bot, the update lands at the Worker, is
parked in the DO mailbox, and the phone's long-poll retrieves it. The **app** then
prompts the holder to approve that chat_id.

**Rejected:** Server-side account system; server-held ACL; app calling Telegram directly.

**Why:** `api.telegram.org` is blocked in Iran, so the phone cannot call `setWebhook`
itself — the Worker must proxy it. And approving destinations on the device means the
authorization root is physical possession of the handset, with no server-side list to
breach or misconfigure. No accounts also means no PII and no user database.

---

## D5 — Crypto primitives (2026-08-30)

**Chosen:**
- Device identity: **ECDSA P-256** in Android Keystore, hardware-backed (StrongBox
  when available, TEE otherwise). Signs every request over a canonical body+timestamp.
- Payload sealing: **HPKE (RFC 9180)** — X25519 + HKDF-SHA256 + ChaCha20-Poly1305 —
  to the Worker's public key.
- Replay defence: timestamp window plus nonce.

**Rejected:** Ed25519 in Keystore.

**Why:** Android Keystore's Ed25519 support is narrow and version-dependent; ECDSA
P-256 is hardware-backed on effectively every device we target. HPKE means Arvan and
the Cloudflare edge relay opaque bytes — the `.ir` leg transits Iranian infrastructure
under Iranian jurisdiction, and sealing is what makes that an acceptable trade rather
than a bad one.

**Amended 2026-08-30, during implementation.** The per-request ECDSA signature was
**removed**. On a relay that stores nothing there is no device registry, so a signature
can only prove that *someone* holds *some* key — it verifies against no known identity
and is therefore decoration. Shipping unverifiable crypto is worse than shipping none,
because it invites the belief that authentication exists.

What replaced it is a one-way hash chain that *is* verifiable without state:

```
channelId  --H-->  secretToken  --H-->  webhookId
 (device)          (Telegram)            (public URL)
```

The relay authorises by hashing forward: a webhook delivery is genuine if
`H(presented secret) == webhookId` in the path, and a mailbox drain is authorised if
`H(H(presented channelId)) == webhookId`. Telegram knows `secretToken` and so can post
updates, but cannot read the mailbox. Anyone who scrapes the public webhook URL gets
`webhookId`, which grants nothing. No stored mapping is required at any point.

Authentication for `/forward` is the **bot token inside the sealed envelope**, which
matches reality — anyone holding that token could message the bot directly regardless.

Keystore-backed ECDSA returns when licensing does (D9): a license token bound to a
device public key makes proof-of-possession meaningful, because then the relay has
something to verify *against*.

## D6 — Multiple bots, not forum topics (2026-08-30)

**Chosen:** Routing table on-device: SIM (pinned to **ICCID**, so it survives a slot
swap) → N destinations, each `(bot, chat_id, label)`. Different SIMs can target
entirely different bots owned by different people.

**Rejected:** One bot, per-SIM forum topics in a shared supergroup.

**Why:** The two-SIM household case is the small case. The product case is N people
who each want their own line in their own bot, not shared visibility into one group.
Separate bots make the trust boundary per-person and need no supergroup setup. Topics
remain possible for anyone who prefers a single bot; they are not the default.

---

## D7 — Foreground service type `specialUse` (2026-08-30)

**Chosen:** `android:foregroundServiceType="specialUse"`.

**Rejected:** `dataSync`.

**Why:** Android 15 caps `dataSync` foreground services at 6 hours per 24h. A
persistent forwarder using it dies daily, silently. `specialUse` has no such cap. The
Play Store justification requirement for `specialUse` does not bind us — distribution
is sideload/direct, and SMS permissions would disqualify us from Play anyway.

---

## D8 — Monetization and payment rails (2026-08-30)

**Chosen:** AGPL-3.0 for everything. Revenue is a subscription to the **hosted relay**,
billed through a **merchant of record** (Paddle or equivalent) once the Finnish `Oy`
exists. No billing code is written before then.

**Rejected:** routing payments through another person's foreign payment account;
open-core with paid modules; Stripe-direct.

**Why:** A foreign payment gateway is not available to an Iran-resident individual.
That constraint is temporary and already scheduled away — the Finland company decision
records that the `Oy` is registered *after* Tampere residency, and relocation is weeks
out. A Finnish `Oy` makes Paddle or Stripe routine.

Borrowing someone else's account is the tempting shortcut and the wrong trade: it
misrepresents beneficial ownership to the provider, moves legal and tax liability onto
whoever's name is on it, and typically ends in frozen funds when the mismatch surfaces.
For a product sold on "don't trust a random OTP forwarder — here is exactly who we
are," opaque ownership destroys the asset being sold. Weeks of delay is the cheaper
side of that trade.

**Merchant of record over Stripe-direct** because MoR absorbs global VAT/sales-tax
registration, invoicing, and chargebacks. Selling a small subscription into thirty
countries as a solo operator, tax compliance is the headache, not card processing.

**Sanctions reality:** paying customers are diaspora holding non-Iranian cards, which
is exactly the target market. Customers still inside Iran cannot be billed by any
Western processor and are served by the free self-hosted path — which the AGPL
guarantees rather than merely permits.

**Consequence:** ship free and self-hostable now. Revenue work starts when the `Oy`
does.

## D9 — Entitlement without a database (2026-08-30)

**Chosen:** Offline-verifiable **signed license tokens**. The billing system issues a
short-lived (≈7 day) Ed25519-signed token to the app; the app presents it with each
relay request; the relay verifies signature and expiry against a public key in its
environment. No lookup, no user record.

**Rejected:** the relay querying a subscriptions table.

**Why:** D3 says the relay stores nothing, and a paid tier is the obvious pressure to
break that. A subscriptions table on the relay reintroduces precisely the user database
this design exists to avoid, and parks billing identity next to message traffic — the
two things that must never be correlatable.

Signed tokens keep the relay stateless and keep billing in a **separate Worker** with
its own storage that never sees message content or bot tokens. The cost is revocation
lag bounded by the token TTL: a cancelled subscription keeps working until the token
expires. That is an acceptable price for not holding a customer database next to
other people's OTPs.

## D10 — The build environment is published, not built locally (2026-08-30)

**Chosen:** CI builds the Android build image and pushes it to
`ghcr.io/<owner>/easyotp-build`. Workstations pull it. `./dev pull` is the normal
path; `./dev build-image` exists as a fallback.

**Rejected:** each developer building the image from the Dockerfile.

**Why:** the primary development machine is in Iran, and measured from it:

| Endpoint | Result |
|---|---|
| `dl.google.com` (Android SDK) | 404 — including permanently valid URLs |
| `developer.android.com` | 403 |
| Docker Hub | 403 |
| `ghcr.io` | reachable, pulls succeed |

Google restricts Android developer downloads from Iranian addresses and Docker Inc.
blocks Iran outright, so a local build fails at the base image before it ever reaches
the SDK. A proxy may or may not cover these depending on its routing rules; depending
on one is not a build system.

Publishing the image is also better on its own terms: the environment CI tests in is
byte-identical to the one on the workstation, which is the usual reason to do this
anyway. The blockade only forced a good practice earlier than convenient.

**Consequence:** contributors inside Iran need a `read:packages` token for ghcr.io and
nothing else. Contributors elsewhere can use either path. This is worth stating in
CONTRIBUTING — a project for Iranians that cannot be built from Iran would be a poor
joke.

## D11 — Dependency mirrors, and the supply-chain debt they create (2026-08-30)

**Chosen:** builds may resolve AndroidX and Gradle plugins through a third-party
mirror, opt-in per machine via `EASYOTP_MIRRORS=true`. CI and unrestricted
contributors use Google and Maven Central directly.

**Rejected:** making the mirror the default; vendoring artifacts into the repo.

**Why:** Google's Maven repository is served from `dl.google.com`, which is blocked
from the primary development machine (D10). Without a mirror the Android build cannot
resolve a single AndroidX artifact, so there is no build at all.

**The debt, stated plainly.** A mirror is an entity that can serve a *different* artifact
than the one the authoritative repository holds. For an app that handles other people's
one-time passwords, silently trusting one is exactly the supply-chain compromise the
threat model is supposed to care about — and it is invisible in a successful build.

Three things keep it honest rather than hidden:

1. **Opt-in and environment-scoped.** It cannot be switched on by a committed file, so
   a contributor never uses a mirror without having typed it.
2. **CI never uses it.** The published APK is built from the authoritative repositories.
3. **Gradle dependency verification is the real fix** — `gradle/verification-metadata.xml`
   with checksums generated in CI from Google and Maven Central, then enforced locally.
   The mirror may then serve bytes, but not *different* bytes.

Item 3 is **not yet implemented** and is the outstanding debt. It should land once the
dependency set stops moving, and before any release build. Until then, a mirrored local
build is a development convenience and must never produce a shipped artifact.

## D12 — Hand-written SQLite for the outbox, not Room (2026-08-30)

**Chosen:** a single `SQLiteOpenHelper` and a small DAO, roughly 150 lines.

**Rejected:** Room with KSP.

**Why:** the outbox is **one table**. Room's value is code generation across a schema
of many entities and relations; here it buys almost nothing and costs an annotation
processor. That processor is not free right now: AGP 9 provides Kotlin support built
in, KSP versions are pinned to exact Kotlin releases, and this project has already
spent several cycles on toolchain drift it did not choose. Adding a codegen plugin to
the critical path of a build that must work from a network where half the ecosystem is
blocked is a poor trade.

It also helps the security story. The outbox is where other people's messages sit at
rest, and a reviewer can read every statement that touches it without first knowing
what Room generated.

**Revisit if** the schema grows past two or three tables with relations between them.

---

## D13 — Encrypt the payload, not the database (2026-08-30)

**Chosen:** message content is sealed with an AES-256-GCM key held in the Android
Keystore and stored as an opaque blob. Queue metadata — the SIM's ICCID, timestamps,
delivery state, attempt counts — is stored in the clear.

**Rejected:** SQLCipher for whole-database encryption.

**Why:** SQLCipher encrypts everything including the columns the queue must sort and
filter on, costs several megabytes of native libraries per ABI, and puts a third-party
crypto implementation on the critical path. Sealing just the payload gives the property
that actually matters — an attacker with the database file gets no message bodies — and
leaves the queue ordinary SQL.

**What this deliberately does not protect:** the metadata. Someone with the file learns
that a given SIM received a message at a given time, and how many messages are pending.
On a device whose physical possession is already game over (THREAT-MODEL A4), spending
complexity to hide timing metadata from an attacker who is holding the SIM would be
theatre.

The Keystore key is non-exportable and hardware-backed where the device offers it, so
the blobs are useless if the database is copied off the device without the key.

---

## D14 — HttpURLConnection, not OkHttp (2026-09-06)

**Chosen:** the platform HTTP client.

**Rejected:** OkHttp.

**Why:** OkHttp 5.5.0 requires compiling against API 37, which is catalogued but
not installable from the stable SDK channel (D10 records the same wall for the
AndroidX generation). Rather than hunt for an older OkHttp release and pin another
dependency to a version nobody upstream is testing, note that Android's
`HttpURLConnection` is *implemented on top of OkHttp* by the platform. The
connection pooling and TLS handling are already there.

What this app asks of an HTTP client is small: POST a sub-kilobyte JSON body with
short timeouts, and later hold a long-poll open for about a minute. All of that is
`setConnectTimeout`, `setReadTimeout`, and a stream.

It also removes a dependency from a security product's supply chain, which is not
nothing while dependency verification is still outstanding (D11).

**Revisit if** the client needs HTTP/2 multiplexing, interceptors, or certificate
pinning against a rotating key set. None of those are on the M1..M3 path.
